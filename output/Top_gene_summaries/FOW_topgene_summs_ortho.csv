"19","P59722","This gene encodes a component of a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in mammalian oxygen homeostasis. Hypoxia reduces the activity of prolyl hyxroxylases that hydroxylate specific proline residues of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (Hif1a). In the absence of hydroxylation, the Hif1a transcription factor accumulates and activates transcription of hypoxia-responsive target genes. This gene encodes one of the three known Hif-interacting 2-oxoglutarate/iron-dependent prolyl-hydroxylases (HIF-PHDs) in rat. Targeted disruption of this gene in mice produced embryonic lethality between embryonic day 12.5 and day 14.5. Based on the transcript data currently available for rat, this Reference Sequence is believed to contain the complete coding region for this gene. However, when compared to its mouse and human orthologs, it has a shorter 5' coding region and an incomplete N-terminus zf-MYND domain. This locus currently has limited transcript data and aligns to an unfinished region of the rat reference genome assembly. It is therefore uncertain whether its coding region can be extended at the 5' end to encode a complete zf-MYND domain, whether no further changes need to be made to its coding region, or whether it is a transcribed pseudogene that does not encode a functional protein. As more transcript and experimental data become available, the coding status of this locus may change.

"37","Q16629","The protein encoded by this gene appears to be multifunctional. Along with PCBP-1 and hnRNPK, it is one of the major cellular poly(rC)-binding proteins. The encoded protein contains three K-homologous (KH) domains which may be involved in RNA binding. Together with PCBP-1, this protein also functions as a translational coactivator of poliovirus RNA via a sequence-specific interaction with stem-loop IV of the IRES, promoting poliovirus RNA replication by binding to its 5'-terminal cloverleaf structure. It has also been implicated in translational control of the 15-lipoxygenase mRNA, human papillomavirus type 16 L2 mRNA, and hepatitis A virus RNA. The encoded protein is also suggested to play a part in formation of a sequence-specific alpha-globin mRNP complex which is associated with alpha-globin mRNA stability. This multiexon structural mRNA is thought to be retrotransposed to generate PCBP-1, an intronless gene with functions similar to that of PCBP2. This gene and PCBP-1 have paralogous genes (PCBP3 and PCBP4) which are thought to have arisen as a result of duplication events of entire genes. This gene also has two processed pseudogenes (PCBP2P1 and PCBP2P2). Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
