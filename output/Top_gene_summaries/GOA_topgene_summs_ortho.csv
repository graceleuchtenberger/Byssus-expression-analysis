"2","Q1HG43","Dual oxidases DUOX1 and DUOX2 are NADPH oxidases which are involved in hydrogen peroxide production necessary for thyroid hormonogenesis. They form a heterodimer with specific maturation factors DUOXA1 and DUOXA2, respectively, which is essential for the maturation and function of the DUOX enzyme complexes. This gene encodes the DUOX1 activator or maturation factor DUOXA1. Rat studies identified a bidirectional promoter which controls the transcription of the DUOX1 and DUOXA1 genes. This protein is cotransported to the cell surface when coexpressed with DUOX1 and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed without DUOX1 protein. The expression of this gene or the DUOX1 gene is not suppressed by thyroglobulin (Tg), a macromolecular precursor in thyroid hormone synthesis, while the expression of the DUOX2 and DUOXA2 are significantly suppressed by the Tg. This protein is also a p53-regulated neurogenic factor involved in p53 dependent neuronal differentiation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

It is associated with the secretory pathway and released in biological fluids. This protein can bind to cells derived from T- and B-lymphocytes, and may regulate cyclosporine A-mediated immunosuppression. Variants have been identified in this protein that give rise to recessive forms of osteogenesis imperfecta.

"40","Q2IBC1","(human ortholog description) The scaffolding protein encoded by this gene is the main component of the caveolae plasma membranes found in most cell types. The protein links integrin subunits to the tyrosine kinase FYN, an initiating step in coupling integrins to the Ras-ERK pathway and promoting cell cycle progression. The gene is a tumor suppressor gene candidate and a negative regulator of the Ras-p42/44 mitogen-activated kinase cascade. Caveolin 1 and caveolin 2 are located next to each other on chromosome 7 and express colocalizing proteins that form a stable hetero-oligomeric complex. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy. Alternatively spliced transcripts encode alpha and beta isoforms of caveolin 1.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2010]","Crassostrea virginica, Crassostrea gigas, Crassostrea angulata, Crassostrea angulata, Dreissena polymorpha, Dreissena polymorpha, Fragum fragum, Gari tellinella, Limnoperna fortunei, Mercenaria mercenaria, Mercenaria mercenaria, Mizuhopecten yessoensis, Mizuhopecten yessoensis, Mya arenaria, Mytilus edulis, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Mytilus coruscus, Ostrea edulis, Pecten maximus, Spisula solida, Tegillarca granosa, Tridacna gigas, Tridacna crocea"

"44","Q8NFW1","This gene encodes member of the collagen family which is thought to contribute to the stabilization of myotendinous junctions and strengthen skeletal muscle attachments during contractile activity. It belongs to the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helix (FACIT) subset of the collagen superfamily, which associate with collagen fibers through their C-terminal collagenous domains and mediate protein-protein interactions through their N-terminal noncollagenous domains. The encoded protein is deposited in the basement membrane zone of the myotendinous junction which is present only at the tissue junctions of muscles, tendons, the heart, articular cartilage, and skin. A knockdown of the orthologous zebrafish gene induces a muscular dystrophy by disruption of the myotendinous junction.
