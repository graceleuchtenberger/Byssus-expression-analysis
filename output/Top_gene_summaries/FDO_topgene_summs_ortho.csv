"7","Q1HG43","Dual oxidases DUOX1 and DUOX2 are NADPH oxidases which are involved in hydrogen peroxide production necessary for thyroid hormonogenesis. They form a heterodimer with specific maturation factors DUOXA1 and DUOXA2, respectively, which is essential for the maturation and function of the DUOX enzyme complexes. This gene encodes the DUOX1 activator or maturation factor DUOXA1. Rat studies identified a bidirectional promoter which controls the transcription of the DUOX1 and DUOXA1 genes. This protein is cotransported to the cell surface when coexpressed with DUOX1 and is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed without DUOX1 protein. The expression of this gene or the DUOX1 gene is not suppressed by thyroglobulin (Tg), a macromolecular precursor in thyroid hormone synthesis, while the expression of the DUOX2 and DUOXA2 are significantly suppressed by the Tg. This protein is also a p53-regulated neurogenic factor involved in p53 dependent neuronal differentiation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

"8","P59722","This gene encodes a component of a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in mammalian oxygen homeostasis. Hypoxia reduces the activity of prolyl hyxroxylases that hydroxylate specific proline residues of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (Hif1a). In the absence of hydroxylation, the Hif1a transcription factor accumulates and activates transcription of hypoxia-responsive target genes. This gene encodes one of the three known Hif-interacting 2-oxoglutarate/iron-dependent prolyl-hydroxylases (HIF-PHDs) in rat. Targeted disruption of this gene in mice produced embryonic lethality between embryonic day 12.5 and day 14.5. Based on the transcript data currently available for rat, this Reference Sequence is believed to contain the complete coding region for this gene. However, when compared to its mouse and human orthologs, it has a shorter 5' coding region and an incomplete N-terminus zf-MYND domain. This locus currently has limited transcript data and aligns to an unfinished region of the rat reference genome assembly. It is therefore uncertain whether its coding region can be extended at the 5' end to encode a complete zf-MYND domain, whether no further changes need to be made to its coding region, or whether it is a transcribed pseudogene that does not encode a functional protein. As more transcript and experimental data become available, the coding status of this locus may change.

"46","Q9NZJ4"," Alpha actinins belong to the spectrin gene superfamily which represents a diverse group of cytoskeletal proteins, including the alpha and beta spectrins and dystrophins.  Alpha actinin is an actin-binding protein with multiple roles in different cell types.  In nonmuscle cells, the cytoskeletal isoform is found along microfilament bundles and adherens-type junctions, where it is involved in binding actin to the membrane.  In contrast, skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle isoforms are localized to the Z-disc and analogous dense bodies, where they help anchor the myofibrillar actin filaments.  This gene encodes a nonmuscle, alpha actinin isoform which is concentrated in the cytoplasm, and thought to be involved in metastatic processes.  Mutations in this gene have been associated with focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis.

At least two isoforms of mammalian arginase exist (types I and II) which differ in their tissue distribution, subcellular localization, immunologic crossreactivity and physiologic function. The type I isoform encoded by this gene, is a cytosolic enzyme and expressed predominantly in the liver as a component of the urea cycle. Inherited deficiency of this enzyme results in argininemia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hyperammonemia. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
